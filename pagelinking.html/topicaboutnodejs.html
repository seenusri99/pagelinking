        <p>What is Node.js?

            Node.js is a runtime server environment that uses JavaScript on the server side and asynchronous programming. It is a free and open source technology that runs on various platforms (Mac OS X, Unix, Windows, etc.).
            
            Node.js can:
            
                Create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
                Generate dynamic page content
                Collect form data
                Add, delete, change data in your database
            
            Features
            
                Easy to learn
                Fast
                No buffering
                Consistent source code
                Massive library support
            
            The Early Beginnings
            
            Believe it or not, Node.js is 12 years old! In comparison, JavaScript is 26 years old and the Internet is 32 years old.
            
            In 2009, Ryan Dahl wrote Node.js. At first, Node.js supported only Mac OS X and Linux. Dahl led the development and maintenance and later it was sponsored by Joyent.
            
            The limited possibilities of the most popular web server at the time, Apache HTTP Server in 2009, was criticized by Dahl because it had to handle a lot of connections concurrently (up to 10,000 and more). When there was any blocked code in the entire process, or an implied multiple execution stack in cases of simultaneous connections, it would lead to issues, and this situation had to be resolved by creating code through sequential programming.
            
            On November 8, 2009 at the inaugural European JSConf, the Node.js project was first demonstrated by Dahl. Node.js is a combination the V8 JavaScript Chrome engine, a low-level I/O API, and an event loop.
            The Evolution
            
            As many browsers competed to offer users the best performance, JavaScript engines also became considerably better. Major browsers worked hard on finding ways to make JavaScript run quicker and offer better support for it. Hence, Node.js was built at the right place and time. It introduced a lot of approaches for JavaScript server-side development and innovative thinking that has helped many developers.
            
            One of the primary factors behind Node.jsâ€™ popularity among developers is its support for thousands of open-source libraries, a large majority of which are hosted on the npm website.
            
            There is also a very active community surrounding Node.js with a lot of developer events and conferences, including Node.js Interactive, Node.js Summit, and NodeConf, as well as other regional events.
            
            Web frameworks were developed by the Node.js open-source community to accelerate the development of applications. These frameworks include Connect, Sails.js, Koa.js, Express.js, Feathers.js, socket.io, Derby, Hapi.js, Meteor, and a lot more.
            The journey so far:
            
            2009
            
                The beginning of Node.js
                npm was created
