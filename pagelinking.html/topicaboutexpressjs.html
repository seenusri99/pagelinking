        <h1>What is ExpressJS?</h1>

Express is a minimalist web framework. It's a layer built on top of the NodeJS and provides you with a robust set of features that make it easy to manage servers and routes. It essentially acts as a series of middleware function calls, each of which performs a specific function. Express is not opinionated, which is why you can use it in various ways. It does not, for example, impose a specific design pattern or folder structure.

Since 2016, the open-source Express project has been managed by the NodeJS Foundation. In recent years, Express has shown a high rate of adoption, with many small-scale companies opting to use the framework. Moreover, many other web frameworks, including Kraken, LoopBack, Keystone, and Sails, also use it.
ExpressJS History

TJ Holowaychuk was the original author and founder of ExpressJS. According to ExpressJS's GitHub repository, the first release occurred on May 22, 2010. Version 0.12 is available.

In June 2014, StrongLoop acquired the rights to manage the project. Then in September 2015, IBM acquired StrongLoop; and later, in January 2016, IBM announced that it would place ExpressJS under the control of the NodeJS Foundation incubator.
Why ExpressJS?

ExpressJS is a minimal framework that supports JavaScript, a widely used language that is simple to learn and is widely supported. This minimalist web framework provides robust set of features that makes it simple to create various types of web and mobile applications in a short amount of time. ExpressJS comes built in with an Express router that provides a simple route handler for client requests. It also includes a middleware responsible for making decisions to respond correctly to the client's requests.

Without Express JS, you must write your own code to create a routing component, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. ExpressJS provides programmers with simplicity, flexibility, efficiency, minimalism, and scalability. Moreover, because it is a Node.JS web application framework, it also offers the advantage of high performance.

Express JS performs all executions extremely quickly thanks to the Event Loop, which eliminates any inefficiency. In addition, Express JS's powerful performance and ease of coding are the most popular features among web application developers. Because it is written in Javascript, it can be used to create websites, web and mobile applications, and even mobile apps. As a result of this, many companies look to hire skilled ExpressJS developers.

Here are some more reasons why developers around the world love ExpressJS:

    Express JS was designed to make it simple to create APIs and web applications.
    It cuts coding time in half while still producing web content.
    Mobile applications are more efficient.
    Another reason to use Express is that it is written in JavaScript, a simple language, even if you have no prior knowledge of any language. Express JS enables a large number of new developers to enter the field of web development.
